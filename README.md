This code is for an Image Captioning Model using a Transformer architecture. The model uses a pre-trained InceptionV3 model as a CNN encoder to extract features from images. These features are then passed through a Transformer encoder and decoder to generate captions. The Transformer architecture includes multi-head attention, position embeddings, and feed-forward networks. The model is trained and evaluated using custom training and testing steps.
